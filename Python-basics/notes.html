    <h1>My Approach to the Problem</h1>

    <h2>Where I Struggled</h2>
    <p>
        One of the first things that tripped me up was publishing to Dev PyPI. I kept running into authentication issues and package naming conflicts.
        Also, figuring out how to make `typer` work properly with argument parsing wasn't as smooth as I expected. Debugging environment variable loading for YAML files was another headache.
    </p>

    <h2>Breaking the Problem Down</h2>
    <p>
        Since the project had multiple components (CLI, YAML-based config, logging, and class-based structures), I split it into smaller sections:
        <ul>
            <li>Setting up the `helloworld` module and making it callable via CLI.</li>
            <li>Integrating configuration management so that settings are loaded dynamically.</li>
            <li>Expanding it to support multiple names with `many-hellos`.</li>
            <li>Logging—turning it on/off at different levels for debugging.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What Went Surprisingly Well</h2>
    <p>
        Using decorators for logging and memoization was easier than expected. I was able to add debugging features without modifying the core logic too much.
        Also, packaging everything properly with `setuptools` turned out to be more straightforward than I initially feared.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
    <p>
        - Always test CLI tools in a fresh environment to avoid hidden dependencies.<br>
        - YAML files can be tricky when loading from different locations. Default fallback options are crucial.<br>
        - PyPI package names are unique—better check if a name is taken before publishing!<br>
        - Logging selectively (turning it on for just the config loader) helps when debugging.
    </p>

    <h2>What AI Helped Me</h2>
    <p>
        I used ChatGPT to clarify certain implementation details, especially with packaging and environment variable handling.
        I also referred to official documentation for `typer`, `setuptools`, and `yaml`.
